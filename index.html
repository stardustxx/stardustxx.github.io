                Hey focuses on setting up tasks between people. You can send a task to another user right now or at the designated time. This was my capstone project on Udacity Android Nanodegree and I will continue maintaining it to solve the problem where people forget
                what they need to do after they were told.

                The idea of Chatter is to allow you to upload images and only the people that are around you can see them. This app was built as one of the Android projects I created to learn more about the platform, API, and practices.

                Chirpin was a website that would connect people and have conversation. It utilized Nodejs with Socket.io to achieve real time chatting experience. This was one of the first sites I built that included the server aspect and the frontend development.
