                            InStream was a side-project created by my friend and I for entering Vancouver UX Competition 2014. The core feature is for the users to search for popular keywords or popular events and InStream will grab the Instagram feeds that are tagged by those keywords and present these photos in photo wall grid-like layout. We used AJAX to communicate with Instagram API to acquire the JSON file. Having wanted to try different technology, we implemented Polymer, which makes everything into component for the ease of adding desired objects. This included the topbar that stays on the top for people to access quickly; the shadow to make the photos become the main subject rather than blending into the background. Also, knowing many people use mobile devices, we have also optimize our website to be mobile compatible. I am mostly in charge of the front end using jQuery and Polymer and to present the easiest user interface and gives the best user experience. <br><br>

                            MissBehua is a beauty store that sells nail foils and they are in need of a way for the distributors to order products from them. Using PHP, we could set up a simple backend that included a database for storing browser sessions and users. By using Masonri JavaScript plugin, we could show all the images of products in a waterfall grid layout that was able to adjust itself depending screen sizes plus users could tap on the photo and see a bigger version through the implementation of LightBox. After users put the number in the text boxes at the bottom of every image, pressing submit button would email the order to the company. This was done through PHP which composed the email in HTML and it was able to send email using the email that already existed on the server since users weren't required to input their own emails. <br><br>
